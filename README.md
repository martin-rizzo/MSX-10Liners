MSX-BASIC / 10 Liner Games
==========================

A couple of MSX games made in 10 lines of pure BASIC.

This project was born as a place to develop my games for the [Basic 10 Liner Contest](https://mobile.twitter.com/basic10l). 
All games contained here run on the [MSX platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) and they can be loaded in any emulator or real hardware.

The contest has 3 game categories:

  * **PUR-80:** 10 lines of code with 80 characters per line max
  * **PUR-120:** 10 lines of code with 120 characters per line max
  * **EXTREME-256:** 10 lines of code with 256 characters per line max
